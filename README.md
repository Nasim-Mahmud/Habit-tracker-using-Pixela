# Habit-tracker-using-Pixela
<a href="https://pixe.la/">Pixela</a> is an API service that, in response to input, creates graphs of your activities.

There are specific parameters to make Pixela API work. First, you need to define a USER_NAME and TOKEN, and you will make these data. Remember, the USER_NAME and TOKEN must be unique. After successfully applying JSON parameters and the endpoint, you will be able to create an account in <a href="https://pixe.la/">Pixela</a>, where you can see your works.

In this project, I made a graph and added pixels to the graph. This graph is based on how many hours I have studied daily. One thing to remember is that the color name of the graph is in Chinese, so you need to follow the documentation as told to avoid any unnecessary errors.

Happy Coding!

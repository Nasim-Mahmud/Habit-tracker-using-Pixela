Pixela is an API service that, in response to input, creates graphs of your activities.

There are specific parameters to make Pixela API work. First, you need to define a USER_NAME and TOKEN, and you will make these data. Remember, the USER_NAME and TOKEN must be unique. After successfully applying JSON parameters and the endpoint, you will be able to create an account in Pixela, where you can see your works.
